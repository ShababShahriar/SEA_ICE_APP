Our project  aims to achieve the dual purpose of helping the Alaskan hunting community on one hand and raising awareness about the affects on climate change on the other hand. It is true that NASA and other government agencies have a plethora of data but most of this data cannot be used directly to help people to take educated decisions on their day to day life. We are building a three way bridge between the massive data producers like NASA, NSIDC, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA), the people of Alaskan hunting community and the scientific community. We are fetching important data like sea-ice Radar, sea-surface temperature, sea-ice fraction, wind speed/direction
velocity of currents, coordinates from data centres of various government and non-government organizations and showing them through a user-friendly and intuitive icon based interface using Google Maps API so that the hunters can make a scientifically sound decision to reduce their risk and maximize their objective. Besides, the users will be able to customize the map with various icons. Moreover, the users will not only consume data but provide their unique insight through image and audio. Those audios will add a human component to the machine generated data and help the scientist to conduct more in-depth research. Besides, our app will work on voice command based UI using android speech-to-text API and hence reducing dependency on finger based interaction to a minimum. We are also adding functionalities using gestures using the in-built Accelerometer sensor of Android. And we will focus a lot on colorful visual icons and meaningful audio reports to enhance user experience and ease of use. To help the user in dire situations, we are adding a distress call option which will pinpoint the exact location (latitude, longitude) of the user and show in a web interface using Google Map. Besides, we will inform the nearby of the emergency users using Google Cloud Messenger. 


innovative:
This app will be a unique platform of using cutting edge technology to help ordinary people earn their sustenance in a safe manner. Besides, people will be able to share their unique insights on the situation at hand very easily through a non-intrusive data collection manner. This will revitalize the dying alaskan languages and preserve the hard earned knowledge of the earlier generations. earned know shed light on the plight of the communities at the forefront of the effects of climate change.
